1. **index.html**: This is the main landing page that replicates the homepage of Udemy. It includes sections like the header, featured courses, categories, testimonials, and footer.

2. **css.html**: This page contains the CSS styles used to style the index page. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other stylistic elements.
